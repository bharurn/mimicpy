# MiMiX
Python package for efficient execution of the new MiMiC QM/MM interface developed at Forschungszentrum Juelich and EPFL. It is currently optimized for simulating protein (including handling non standard ligands). It can also run pure MM simulation using Gromacs back-end, and has support for submitting jobs to a remote server.
