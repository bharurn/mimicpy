# MiMiCPy
MiMiCPy is the python library for preparing QM/MM simulations with the MiMiC CPMD/Gromacs interface developed at Forschungszentrum Juelich and EPFL. [1] For more details on compiling the MiMiC source code, please refer to [2].

MiMiCPy comes with a set of command lines tools to prepare MiMiC input scripts. Additionally, plugins for PyMOL and VMD are also provided.

## Installation
To install, clone this repo and install using ```setup.py``` in the root folder.
```
git clone https://github.com/bharurn/mimicpy
pip install mimicpy
```
Here ```mimicpy/``` is the directory to which this repo was cloned to.

To install with PyMOL and/or VMD support, pass the plugin path to ```PYMOLDIR``` or ```VMDDIR```. This path is usually either the path to PyMOL/VMD installation folder, or the user home directory. For example,
```
PYMOLDIR="/home/user/" VMDDIR="/home/user/" pip install mimicpy
```

## Portability Issues
MiMiCPy requires Python >= 3.5, pandas >= 0.24.0 and numpy >= 1.12.0. The plugins have been tested with PyMOL version 2.3.4 and VMD version 1.9.4a38, although other versions are expected to work. If a compatibility issue is found, please send us a bug report.

## Demo
A demo of selection of atoms for the QM region, and generation of the CPMD-MiMiC input script using MiMiCPy is shown below.
```console
user@system:~$ mimicpy prepqm -top acetone.top -coords acetone.gro


 	                ***** MiMiCPy *****

 	 For more information type mimicpy [subcommand] --help

**Reading topology**

Cannot find path to Gromacs installation.
Read atoms from acetone.itp.
No atoms found in acetone.top.

Some atom types had no atom numbers information.
They were guessed as follows:

+---------------------+
| Atom Type | Element |
+---------------------+
|     c     |    C    |
+---------------------+
|     c3    |    C    |
