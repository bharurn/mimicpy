The `ChemCompId` tag in the SDF file is taken as the molecule name, and Amber prep and/or frcmod files with this name is searched in the current directory. Using the programs available from AmberTools (parmchk and tleap), the Amber topologies are generated which are then converted to Gromacs topologies using Acpype. The position restratin file for the ligand is also written.\n",
