    "Before starting and runs, it is important to discuss the concept of the \"host\" in MiMiCPy. The host is the handle that controls executiong of all jobs and commands, in essence it is a wrapper for a shell terminal. When the MiMiCPy module is imported, a host is automatically started on the local machine, or localhost. The current host can be obtained by calling the `getHost()` function"
