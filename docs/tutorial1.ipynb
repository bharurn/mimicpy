    "\n",
    "This is the first tutorial on how to get MiMiCPy running, and deals with setting up the host system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting any runs, it is important to discuss the concept of the \"host\" in MiMiCPy. The host controls executiong of all jobs and commands, in essence it is a wrapper for a shell terminal. The host can be set up to run on the local machine, or on a remote machine.\n",

    "\n",
    "When the MiMiCPy module is imported, a host is automatically started on the local machine, or `localhost`. The current host can be obtained by calling the `getHost()` function."
